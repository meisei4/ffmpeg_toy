TODOs!!!!!!!!!!!!: 
1. add more merging/overlays like colors and other effects to test 6
2. make it so that the speed exponentially increases to eventually match the plaback rate of the musical cue segment
3. JUST REFACTOR EVERYTHING TO BE LESS UGLY (this whole thing is straight up wrapping ffmpeg commands in the most useless way)
4. start composing json files for the input for the tool. the cmd/arg format is getting unwieldy
